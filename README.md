## How to build it

Building the blog locally is very simple. As we're using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), some previous preparition is needed:

-   Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/);

-   install [gems](http://rubygems.org/);

-   install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

Having the requirements prepared, build it with jekyll:


```bash
$ jekyll serve
```
